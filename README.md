# telecom_customer-
this is python file which is done by machine learning to understad the telecustomer user

Tele.ipynb is the pythin file 
the total code is in that .

\\
1)
We have done the EDA for the dataset 
2)
After that we used matplot and seaborn libraries to plots some graphs ,
which helps us to find the Dependent and independent variables .
3)
we have used RandomForestClassifier and AdaBoost algorithms for the accuracy calculation and predictions

IMP 
 THIS IS ONLY THE PYTHON CODE 
THIS HELPS ONLY FOR THE MODEL TRAINING 
AND TO CALCULATE THE ACCURACY
